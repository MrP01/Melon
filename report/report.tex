    In this project we will implement a task scheduling method on the basis of a \gls{mcmc} method with Simulated Annealing. The project is publicly available as a software package \textbf{melon-scheduler} on PyPi and entirely original.
    The package can download tasks from a \glsname{caldav} server, store and load them locally, synchronise with updates from the server and finally, schedule them into a calendar.
    It also comes with a \glsname{gui}, cf. \Cref{fig:gui}.

    The key algorithm described in this report is the \gls{mcmc} scheduling procedure, taking a set of tasks as an input and returning an ordered set of time slots as output.
    The attached code contains four original implementations of the algorithm in three different languages: Python, Rust and C++.

    We will compare the performance of the four different implementations to see whether outsourcing performance-critical sections of code to low-level languages is worth the effort in the context of scientific computing.

    % Python module bindings to these low-level language implementations are provided using \texttt{rust-cpython} and \texttt{pybind11}, respectively.

The grey text on the side represents the relevant due date. Selecting a calendar (todo-list) from the list on the left-hand side will filter the task list to only that category.}

  \section{Conclusion}
  In this Special Topic, we implemented a task scheduling application, tested it thoroughly (code coverage over 90 \%) and used it for the development of a Todo List Application.
  The optimisation is done using a \glstext{mcmc} method with Simulated Annealing.
  This algorithm was implemented four times, in Python, Rust and C++.
  Its key objective is to minimise a function (energy), the time development of which may be found in \Cref{fig:convergence-14h} and \Cref{fig:convergence-8h}.

  As expected, the low-level language implementations in Rust and C++ outperformed the high-level language implementation in Python by nearly two orders of magnitude.
  The just-in-time compilation optimisation using Numba also achieved a significant speed-up as compared to the pure Python implementation, but did not match that of Rust or C++.
  Specific runtime benchmarks can be found in \Cref{table:runtime}.
  We also analysed the runtime complexity of the algorithm, which may be found in \Cref{fig:complexity}.

  \section{Accessing VTODO properties}
  A profiler may be used to identify parts of the code that are slow.
  In the case of the \gls{gui}, the Item Delegate's paint() method must be performant in order to provide a smooth user experience.
  This can be achieved when looking at different means of accessing the UID of a task, which as per \Cref{table:paint-profile} is a highly frequent action.
  Here is a comparison of different approaches:

  \begin{minted}{python}
    In [1]: %timeit str(t.icalendar_component["uid"])
      122 µs ± 1.06 µs per loop (7 runs, 10,000 loops each)
    In [2]: %timeit t.vtodo.contents["uid"][0].value
      355 ns ± 7.14 ns per loop (7 runs, 1,000,000 loops each)
    In [3]: %timeit t.vobject_instance.contents["vtodo"][0].contents["uid"][0].value
      296 ns ± 7.06 ns per loop (7 runs, 1,000,000 loops each)
    In [4]: %timeit t._vobject_instance.contents["vtodo"][0].contents["uid"][0].value
      208 ns ± 23.7 ns per loop (7 runs, 10,000,000 loops each)
  \end{minted}

  As we can see, the last option is the fastest which has therefore been implemented in \texttt{todo.py}.
